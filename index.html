                                    <p>Your body language is the first thing people notice. Take a deep breath and calm yourself. Try to be as relaxed as possible. Maintain a calm, open stance (no crossed arms), keep your hands visible, and respect personal space. Your facial expression should be neutral and compassionate, not judgmental. Use a low, calm tone of voice. Speak slowly and evenly. The volume and speed of your speech can either escalate or de-escalate the tension.</p>

                                    <p>Don't interrupt. Let the person vent their frustrations. Reflect their feelings back to them (e.g., "It sounds like you're feeling ignored"). This validates their emotion and shows you are genuinely trying to understand. Do this in your own natural way. Continue until they can see that you accept their emotional state and are not judging them for it. "Until they feel validated."</p>

                                    <p>It is important that an agitated person doesn't feel backed into a corner. Be sure to help them explore their choices. As they calm a little you might be able to help them with some options. e.g. "You could go in and shout at the vicar in front of everyone, but someone would probably call the police, or you could meet with the vicar after the service and talk about your concerns then. </p>
